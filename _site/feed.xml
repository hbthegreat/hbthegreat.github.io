        <title>Welcome to Hbthegreat&#39;s Blog!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the online home of code/games/stories and all other things I feel like posting. I have put this blog together as I have finally reached the point of having enough time to getting around to making it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly a bit about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My real name is Ryan Handby and I currently live in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love techonology and programming - I have been this way since my first computer when I was 2 or 3 years old. I picked up programming when I was about 7-8 years old and started building websites when I was 12.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love video games - I have played many games over the years with my favourites coming in the forms of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series, Battlefield 2 and 2142, World of Warcraft and my most recent love Hearthstone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love craft beers and good foods - in saying this I love experimenting with strange combinations of foods and cocktails. Lifes too short for boring right?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer in giving everything at least one try before writing it off (unless it seems completely outrageous)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love my beautiful girlfriend (if I didn’t add this I am sure she would notice eventually :P)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
