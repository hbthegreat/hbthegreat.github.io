Welcome to the online home of code/games/stories and all other things I feel like posting. I have put this blog together as I have finally reached the point of having enough time to getting around to making it.

Firstly a bit about me.

* My real name is Ryan Handby and I currently live in Melbourne, Australia.

* I love techonology and programming - I have been this way since my first computer when I was 2 or 3 years old. I picked up programming when I was about 7-8 years old and started building websites when I was 12.

* I love video games - I have played many games over the years with my favourites coming in the forms of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, Battlefield 2 and 2142, World of Warcraft and my most recent love Hearthstone.

* I love craft beers and good foods - in saying this I love experimenting with strange combinations of foods and cocktails. Lifes too short for boring right?

* I am a firm believer in giving everything at least one try before writing it off (unless it seems completely outrageous)

* I love my beautiful girlfriend (if I didn't add this I am sure she would notice eventually :P)
