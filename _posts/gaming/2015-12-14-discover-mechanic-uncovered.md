Disclaimer: This article will continue to grow as I spend more time exploring the mechanic.

<p>The League of Explorers brought many new cards and dynamics to our beloved game Hearthstone and in my opinion the majority of the introduced cards have been both playable and add excitement to the game. This has been through new deck innovations and slight meta shifts which have been quite a welcome addition considering how stale the game can sometimes get during different parts of an expansion cycle. </p>

<p>I could write a lengthy article on each of the new cards but as others have already touched on most of those aspects I'd like to put the new mechanic Discover under a finer microscrope.</p>
