<b>Disclaimer: This article will continue to grow as I spend more time exploring the mechanic.</b>

<p>The League of Explorers brought many new cards and dynamics to our beloved game Hearthstone and in my opinion the majority of the introduced cards have been both playable and add excitement to the game. This has been through new deck innovations and slight meta shifts which have been quite a welcome addition considering how stale the game can sometimes get during different parts of an expansion cycle. </p>

<p>I could write a lengthy article on each of the new cards but as others have already touched on most of those aspects I'd like to put the new mechanic Discover under a finer microscrope.</p>

<p>Before we deep dive head first into discover statistics it is important to understand the basic rules of the mechanic so that we can properly investigate the cards and their power levels.</p>
<p>Below are the rules and assumptions that need to be taken into account:</p>

* Discover presents you with 3 random options in most cases these are minions or spells. The only exceptions thus far are Sir Finley Mrgrglton that presents 3 options of basic hero powers that doesn't include your current hero power and Arch-Thief Rafaam that gives the option between his 3 powerful spells.
* The player must make a choice of one of the 3 options. It is not possible to "not" choose if you dislike the provided options.
* All 3 choices must be legal for your class. Neutral and Class minions and spells count as being legal.
* When a Discovery takes place Class cards are 4 times more likely to be presented as a choice than Neutral cards.
* Discovered cards are not taken out of your deck unlike the Hunter card tracking.

<p>In order to properly explore the probabilities of drawing the cards you are looking for using Discover we will use the following formula(a Hypergeometric Distribution):</p>
> <img src="/images/hypergeomdist.jpg"> where
>
> <b>k</b> is the number of "successes" in the population (This is the amount of a type of card in the sample for example 5 legendaries out of 300 choices)
>
> <b>x</b> is the number of "successes" in the sample (This is the amount of cards of a particular displayed each time discover is used out of the 3 that are presented)
>
> <b>N</b> is the size of the population (This will be the total number of cards that we are choosing from)
>
> <b>n</b> is the number sampled (As the discover mechanic always gives you 3 options this will be 3 in all situations for us)
>
> <b>p</b> is the probability of obtaining exactly x successes (This will be the probability of getting the choice of x number of cards that meet the criteria)
>
> <b><sub>k</sub>C<sub>x</sub></b> is the number of combinations of k things taken x at a time



<p>Now that we know all the rules surrounding Discover lets take a look at each of the cards. (Click each card name to reveal its stats)</p>

     Sir Finley was chosen as the first card as it is the only Discover minion that does not Discover cards but instead he Discovers one of 3 new basic hero powers. As the hero power is always a new hero power that leaves us with only 8 of the 9 remaining starting hero powers to choose from. So what is the % chance to be offered exactly the hero power you are looking for when playing Sir Finley?
The answer will be here soon
     All stuff about sir finley will be here including stats. Playability. Synergy scenarios etc

        <p>The Raven Idol is probably one of the most complex Discover mechanics in the entire game by allowing a Druid or a player that has gained a copy of this card through other methods access to nearly any card in the game that is legal for their class.</p>
        <p>For the sake of simplicty this analysis will assume that the player of the card is a Druid. I will release a calculator at a later date for other classes if they get this spell through Cho/Thought Steal/Nefarian etc.</p>
        <p>Things to note about this card. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You first have the choice between a spell OR a minion not both! So you have to choose wisely in order to gain an advantage off this card.</li>
          <li>Selecting the spell option limits you as stated above to class spells.</li>
          <li>Selecting the minion option allows choices between both neutral and class minions</li>
          <li>There are currently 26 spell options to choose from.</li>
          <li>There are currently 331 minion options to choose from.</li>
          <li>Of the 331 minion options, there are only 67 Legendaries to choose from.</li>
          <li>Of the 331 minion options, there are only 33 Epics to choose from.</li>
          <li>Of the 331 minion options, there are only 74 Rares to choose from.</li>
          <li>Of the 331 minion options, there are only 157 Commons to choose from.</li>
          <li>Of the 331 minion options, there are only 21 are Druid class minions, which are 4 times more likely to be discovered</li>
        </ul>

        <div>In terms of our formula above we can subsitute in our values about Raven Idol to get a close look at the likelyhood of getting getting the cards you are looking for; for those mathematically inclined read along below, anyone else feel free to skip past it to find out the results.</div>
        <div>One thing to note is that with the Class minions being 4 times more likely to be discovered we have to allow for that in our calculations. I will be taking the route of multiplying those card numbers by 4 just to keep this as simple as possible.</div>

        <p>The Dark Peddler is one of the more straight forward Discover mechanics in the game although does have some complexity by allowing both spells or minions to be discovered.
          It allows a Warlock or a player that has gained a copy of this card through other methods access to all class and neutral 1 cost minions and spells.</p>
        <p>For the sake of simplicty this analysis will assume that the player of the card is a Warlock. I will release a calculator at a later date for other classes if they get this card through Cho/Thought Steal/Nefarian etc.</p>
        <p>Things to note about this card.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are currently 38 cards to choose from.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there are only 1 Legendaries.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there is only 1 Epic.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there are only 9 Rares.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there are only 27 Commons.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there are only 8 Warlock class cards.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there are only 4 taunts.</li>
          <li>Of the 38 options, there are only 4 spells.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In terms of our formula above we can subsitute in our values about Museum Curator to get a close look at the likelyhood of getting the cards you are looking for;
        for those mathematically inclined read along below. anyone else feel free to skip past it to find out the results.</p>
        <p>One thing to note is that with the Class minions being 4 times more likely to be discovered we have to allow for that in our calculations. I will be taking the route of multiplying those card numbers by 4 just to keep things as simple as possible.</p>

          <h3>Chance of getting x number of Taunt minions presented.</h3>
          <div>Out of the 4 possibilties of Taunt minions there are 1 Warlock class minions making the total Taunt count 7.</div>
          <div>Out of the 38 possibilities of cards to be presented 8 are Warlock class cards making the total card count 62.</div>
          <blockquote>
            <div><b>k</b> = 4 (there are 4 possible Taunt possibilities from Dark Peddler)</div>
            <div><b>x</b> = Can be 0,1,2 or 3 this is the amount of cards presented that ARE Taunt</div>
            <div><b>N</b> = There are 62 total possible cards</div>

          <div>Putting these values into our formula above we can establish the following probabilities (rounded to 4 decimal places):</div>
