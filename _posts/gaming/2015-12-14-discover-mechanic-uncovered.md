Disclaimer: This article will continue to grow as I spend more time exploring the mechanic.

<p>The League of Explorers brought many new cards and dynamics to our beloved game Hearthstone and in my opinion the majority of the introduced cards have been both playable and add excitement to the game. This has been through new deck innovations and slight meta shifts which have been quite a welcome addition considering how stale the game can sometimes get during different parts of an expansion cycle. </p>

<p>I could write a lengthy article on each of the new cards but as others have already touched on most of those aspects I'd like to put the new mechanic Discover under a finer microscrope.</p>

<p>Before we deep dive head first into discover statistics it is important to understand the basic rules of the mechanic so that we can properly investigate the cards and their power levels.</p>
<p>Below are the rules and assumptions that need to be taken into account:</p>

* Discover presents you with 3 random options in most cases these are minions or spells. The only exceptions thus far are Sir Finley Mrgrglton that presents 3 options of basic hero powers that doesn't include your current hero power and Arch-Thief Rafaam that gives the option between his 3 powerful spells.
* The player must make a choice of one of the 3 options. It is not possible to "not" choose if you dislike the provided options.
* All 3 choices must be legal for your class. Neutral and Class minions and spells count as being legal.
* When a Discovery takes place Class cards are 4 times more likely to be presented as a choice than Neutral cards.
* Discovered cards are not taken out of your deck unlike the Hunter card tracking.

<p>Now that we know all the rules surrounding Discover lets take a look at each of the cards. (Click each card image to reveal its stats)</p>
