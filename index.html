  <p>Hi there! I see that you have stumbled across my home on the interwebs. I blog about a wide range of topics and am a bit all over the place in terms of what I am focussing on in my personal projects so hopefully you can navigate my online whiteboard session.</p>

  <p>You may have got here from various places around the web as I am part of quite a few communities.</p>
  <p>If you have been directed there through anything to do with <a href="/programming">programming</a> you are most likely going to be more interested in my articles and thoughts about <a href="/programming">programming</a>.</p>
  <p>Some of you may have come to visit by various gaming channels as I do like to dabble in quite a bit of <a href="gaming">pro-gaming</a> on the side. So you will probably be after more of my <a href="gaming">gaming</a> content</p>
  <p>Other people may have got here due to reading something about my <a href="/entrepreneurial">entrepreneurial</a> life. I like to write about cool projects I am involved in and also what other cool <a href="/entrepreneurial">entrepreneurs</a> are currently doing.</p>
  <p>If you just stumbled onto this site through <a href="/general">general</a> web browsing then you may be more interested in some of my articles that are <a href="/general">generally</a> politcal, worldly or philisophical in nature. I also like to sometimes talk about my family and my dog.</p>
